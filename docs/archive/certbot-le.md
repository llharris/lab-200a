# Certbot

Cerbot is a utility for managing certificates from Let's Encrypt. It can automatically configure some webservers with SSL certs, but for my purposes I'm just going to use it to generate certificates for manual configuration using the `certonly` mode.

## Certonly Manual Mode

The easiest way to run certbot interactively is to use: `certbot certonly --manual` and follow the prompts. This process looks like...

```
root@ubuntu-vm:/home/llharris/docker# certbot certonly --manual

At this point, I need to go and create a TXT record in my DNS management interface which is hosted by Cloudflare.

Cleaning up challenges

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/home.200a.co.uk/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/home.200a.co.uk/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2021-01-25. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
```

My certificate and chain are saved in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/home.200a.co.uk/fullchain.pem and my keyfile (which only exists locally) is in /etc/letsencrypt/live/home.200a.co.uk/privkey.pem.

Now, obviously doing this process manually is great for the purposes of testing, but because these certificates are free, one of the drawbacks is that they expire every 90 days, as specified in the certbot output above. This means that you'd have to manually renew the certificate before the 90 days elapses and then go through the process of configuring whatever web service it is that was using the certificate to use the new version...which is a pain.

Anyway.

Under `/etc/letsencrypt/live/home.200a.co.uk` I have the following:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 692 Oct 27 21:46 README
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  39 Oct 27 21:46 cert.pem -> ../../archive/home.200a.co.uk/cert1.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  40 Oct 27 21:46 chain.pem -> ../../archive/home.200a.co.uk/chain1.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  44 Oct 27 21:46 fullchain.pem -> ../../archive/home.200a.co.uk/fullchain1.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  42 Oct 27 21:46 privkey.pem -> ../../archive/home.200a.co.uk/privkey1.pem
```

We can view the certificate contents and make sure that the X509 Subject Alternative DNS name matches our domain. In my case I want a wildcard domain certificate because I intent to use the same cert on everything...because I'm lazy and this is just a lab at the end of the day.

Run the command: `openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout`

You should get something like this...

```

### Using the Certificate

First port of call is to SSL enable Cockpit which is running on my main CentOS 8 box. The machine is called `deskmini.home.200a.co.uk` and resolves in DNS to `192.168.200.254`.

If I SSH onto that machine, and run `remotectl certificate` I can see that the current certificate in use by Cockpit is the default self-signed one: `certificate: /etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d/0-self-signed.cert`

Cockpit's self-signed cert is actually a concatenation of the private key and certificate. Cockpit will also utilise the highest numbered file within the directory `/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d` as the web server certificate.

All I need to do is copy the private key and certificate to the machine running cockpit, concatenate them together and send the output to a suitably named file in the right location: `cat letsencrypt/privkey.pem letsencrypt/cert.pem > /etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d/50-letsencrypt.cert`

Then restart cockpit: `systemctl restart cockpit.socket`

And voil√°:
